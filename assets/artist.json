It was later released to mainstream and rhythmic contemporary radio on August 13, 2013.\n\nThe song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, as well as number five on the singles chart in his native Canada. The song received positive reviews from music critics and was named the best song of 2013 by Pitchfork Media as well as number 21 on its \"Best Tracks of the Decade\" list.\n\nBefore \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" was released, Drake had an interview with MTV News about the song during the 4th Annual OVO Fest saying, \"It's me and 40 just channeling our Quincy Jones/Michael Jackson production duo,... Obviously no offense to the greats, I know we're not anywhere near that — it's just us kinda doing our thing, humbly attempting.\" He also added, \"It's not a rap record,... It's not 'Versace,' it's not 'Started from the Bottom.' In approaching this album I was like man, it would be great if we had a record that was played at weddings in 10 years or that people that are away from their families in the Armed Forces could listen to. Something that just [has] timeless writing, timeless melody. So I did it with the group that we signed to OVO called Majid Jordan.\"\n\n\"Hold On, We're Going Home\" debuted at number five on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making it Drake's thirty-third top 10 hit on the chart. This accomplishment broke the tie for second-most top ten hits with singer R. Kelly, only trailing behind rapper Lil Wayne, who has 36. The song also made the top ten in the Canadian Hot 100, peaking at number five, making it his highest-charting single in his home country. In the song's fifth week on the US Billboard Hot 100, it became Drake's 13th top ten hit, climbing at number eight. This feat gave him the most top ten hits of the year with four, including \"Fuckin' Problems\" (number 8), \"Started from the Bottom\" (number 6), and \"Love Me\" (number 9). The song reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Drake's first song to reach the top five of the Hot 100 since \"Find Your Love\". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It sold over two million copies as of January 2014. The song sold 207,000 copies in Canada in 2013. The single reached a peak of number four in the United Kingdom, giving Drake his highest-peaking single there at the time (\"One Dance\" later reached number one in 2016). It also received heavy rotation on South African radio stations, peaking a number one on the South African Airplay Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Hold+On,+We%27re+Going+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The lead single from his debut album Thank Me Later was written by Drake with Boi-1da, and produced by the latter and Al Khaaliq (Nick Brongers). The orchestral samples were composed and arranged by Brongers. The single was released for digital download on March 8, 2010. The song is midtempo hip-hop with an orchestral backdrop, whose lyrics concern an introduction to fame. Drake references the classic opening verse of “Hip-Hop” by Dead Prez.\n\nIt peaked in the top twenty of the United States and Canada, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted within the top five on the U.S. R&B and rap charts, his fourth consecutive top five on those charts. The song also charted in the United Kingdom and its R&B chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an experience, and the struggle between his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.\n\n\"Shut It Down\" was originally planned to be released as the first single from Thank Me Later in late 2009, but Drake ultimately chose \"Over\", a song produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Forever\". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. Drake did a lot of work for the song and the album in Jamaica.\n\nThe song \"touches on Drake reaction to fame and stardom\"; Drake told MTV News that the song was \"definitely\" a choice of his for releasing as a single, and that it was a song he did for himself. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness\". The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Cragg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's \"Hip-Hop\", from their 2000 debut, \"Let's Get Free\". He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his \"Thriller\" video, and commented, \"He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately, what happened to him, just to honor him was great\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The chorus of \"The A Team\" was also used by Sheeran in the track \"Little Lady\", which features Mikill Pane. \"Little Lady\" is available on the EP No. 5 Collaborations Project.\n\nThe A Team Songfacts explains the song is a true story and was written by Sheeran after meeting a homeless prostitute called Angel, whilst volunteering at a Crisis homeless shelter. The song became the highest selling debut single on the UK singles charts in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe song is a story about a girl he met whilst volunteering at a homeless shelter – it soared into the top three on its release in June 2011. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/The+A+Team\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released to US radio stations as the second single from 1989 on November 10, 2014, by Republic Records in partnership with Big Machine. Swift co-wrote \"Blank Space\" with its producers Max Martin and Shellback. In the lyrics, she conceived the song as a satirical self-referential nod to her reputation as a flirtatious woman with a series of romantic attachments, which blemished her once-wholesome girl next door image. Musically, it is an electropop song with minimal hip hop-influenced beats.\n\n\"Blank Space\" spent seven weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Iceland, Scotland, and South Africa. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that \"Blank Space\" was one of the best-selling singles of 2015. Critics praised the song's production and Swift's songwriting; some picked it as 1989's highlight. The song earned three nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards, including two general categories: Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It featured on decade-end lists by such publications as Billboard, Rolling Stone, and Slant Magazine.\n\nJoseph Kahn directed the music video for \"Blank Space\", which depicts Swift as a jealous woman who acts erratically upon suspecting her boyfriend's infidelity. Photography took place mostly at Oheka Castle, with a few additional scenes shot at Woolworth Estate. The video won Best Pop Video and Best Female Video at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. Swift included \"Blank Space\" on the set lists for three of her concert tours: the 1989 World Tour (2015), Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), and the Eras Tour (2023). The song has been adapted into cover versions of different genres by several rock musicians, including I Prevail and Ryan Adams. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Blank+Space\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was the lead single from 1989, which Swift marketed as her first pop album. It was released for digital download worldwide on August 19, 2014, by Big Machine Records.\n\nContemporary critics found the song's dance-pop production catchy, but some believed the lyrics were weak. Retrospectively, critics have considered \"Shake It Off\" an effective opener for the 1989 era, which transformed Swift's sound and image from country to pop. The song featured on 2010s-decade-end lists by NME and Consequence. In the U.S., the single spent 50 weeks–including four weeks at number one–on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Shake It Off\" also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Mexico, New Zealand, and Poland.\n\nThe single was supported by a music video directed by Mark Romanek. The video, in which Swift portrays a clumsy person attempting to practice several dance moves without success, attracted accusations of cultural appropriation for featuring dance routines associated with people of color such as twerking. To promote the song, Swift performed on televised live events including the MTV Video Music Awards and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. She included \"Shake It Off\" on the set lists for three of her world tours: the 1989 World Tour (2015), Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), and the Eras Tour (2023). The song has received numerous accolades, including Favorite Song at the 2015 People's Choice Awards and three Grammy nominations at the 2015 Grammy Awards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Shake+It+Off\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Inspired by a boy who was unpopular with her family and friends, Swift wrote the song using William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet as a reference point. The lyrics narrate a troubled romance that ends with a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the midtempo country pop song includes a key change after the bridge and uses acoustic instruments including banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and guitar.\n\nAt the time of its release, music critics praised the production but deemed the literary references ineffective. In retrospect, critics have considered it one of Swift's best singles. \"Love Story\" peaked atop the chart in Australia, where it was certified ten-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and reached the top five on charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, and the UK. In the U.S., the single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on the Mainstream Top 40. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it eight-times platinum. \"Love Story\" has sold over six million copies in the U.S. and 18 million copies worldwide.\n\nTrey Fanjoy directed the accompanying music video, which stars Swift and Justin Gaston as lovers in a prior era. Drawing from historical periods such as the Renaissance and the Regency era, it won Video of the Year at both the Country Music Association Awards and CMT Music Awards in 2009. The song became a staple in Swift's live concerts and has been a part of the set lists in all of her headlining tours from the Fearless Tour (2009–2010) to the Eras Tour (2023). Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song and released it as \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\" in February 2021. The re-recorded single topped the Hot Country Songs chart and made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to reach number one with both the original and re-recorded versions of a song. It also reached number one in Malaysia. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Love+Story\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Swift wrote the song with producers Max Martin, Shellback, and Ali Payami. \"Style\" was released to radio on February 9, 2015, by Big Machine in partnership with Republic Records. An incorporation of pop, funk, disco, and electronic styles, \"Style\" is built on an electric guitar riff, pulsing synthesizers, and dense vocal reverb. The lyrics are about an on-and-off couple stuck in an unhealthy relationship because they are never \"out of style\".\n\nWhen \"Style\" was first released, critics generally praised the production and deemed it a highlight of 1989, but a few considered the lyrics unsophisticated. In retrospect, critics have regarded it as one of Swift's best songs. \"Style\" was ranked in year-end best-of lists by Pitchfork (2014) and Pazz & Jop (2015). In the US, the single peaked at number six and was 1989's third consecutive top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, and it was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Style\" also reached the top ten and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia and Canada.\n\nFilmmaker Kyle Newman directed the song's music video featuring actor Dominic Sherwood as Swift's love interest. Premiering on February 13, 2015, the video featured a darker and more abstract atmosphere compared to those for previous 1989 singles \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space\". Swift included \"Style\" on regular set lists for three of her world tours: the 1989 World Tour (2015), the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), and the Eras Tour (2023). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Style\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released to US radio on April 20, 2009, as the third single from her second studio album, Fearless (2008). Inspired by a phone call between a member of her touring band and his girlfriend that she overheard, Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose to depict a narrator's unrequited love for a boy unappreciated by his girlfriend. Swift and Nathan Chapman produced \"You Belong with Me\", which features a banjo-led production and incorporates fiddle, mandolin, and rock-influenced bass and electric guitars. Although the single was promoted to country radio by Big Machine Records, critics deemed it a pop song that stylistically aligns with 1980s subgenres such as pop rock and power pop.\n\nWhen \"You Belong with Me\" was first released, critics praised the song's radio-friendly production and emotional engagement that appealed to a broad audience, although some deemed Swift's songwriting formulaic. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, \"You Belong with Me\" was nominated in three categories, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The single reached the top ten on charts and received sales certifications in Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on both Hot Country Songs and the all-genre Radio Songs chart. The single was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nRoman White directed the song's music video, which stars Swift as both the antagonist—an unsympathetic, popular cheerleader, and the protagonist—a sympathetic girl-next-door who yearns for the antagonist's boyfriend; some critics took issue with the video's narrative as antifeminist. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video, rapper Kanye West interrupted Swift's acceptance speech, which caused a controversy widely covered by the media. Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song as \"You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)\" for her re-recorded album Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021). \"You Belong with Me\" was included on the set lists of five of her headlining tours. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/You+Belong+with+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the lead single for her eighth studio album, Folklore, on July 27, 2020, via Republic Records. Written by Swift and its producer Aaron Dessner, \"Cardigan\" is a folk, soft rock, and indie rock ballad, with a stripped-down arrangement of a piano, drums, and violins.\n\nThe song's lyrics discuss a romance lost in memories, from the perspective of a female narrator named Betty, one of the several fictitious characters narrated in Folklore. An accompanying music video for the song, written, directed, and styled by Swift, was released alongside the album launch. The video has been described as following a cottagecore aesthetic, featuring Swift in three different settings: a \"cozy cabin\" in the woods, a moss-covered forest, and a dark stormy sea, which represents the concept of the different phases in relationships. \"Cardigan\" was praised by music critics for its poetic songwriting and laid-back sound. It received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. An acoustic version of the song, branded as \"Cabin in Candlelight\", was also released.\n\nCommercially, \"Cardigan\" debuted atop the global Spotify songs chart with over 7.742 million streams, which was, at that time, the biggest opening day for a song on the platform in 2020. With the song's debut at the number-one spot of the Billboard Hot 100 as well, Swift scored the sixth U.S. number-one single of her career. Along with Folklore's debut atop the Billboard 200 the same week, she became the first artist ever to simultaneously debut atop the Hot 100 and Billboard 200. \"Cardigan\" further topped the Hot Alternative Songs, Hot Rock & Alternative Songs, Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts, making Swift the first act in history to garner twenty chart-toppers on the latter. It reached number one in Australia, the top ten in Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Scotland. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/carDIGan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Songfacts reports that the song was Taylor's first ever #1 on the American Hot 100.\n\nAfter writing Speak Now (2010) entirely solo, she opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for Red. Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired fondly, to discuss a possible collaboration. The trio conceived the concept for \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" incidentally after a friend of Swift's ex-boyfriend walked into the recording studio and spoke of rumors he heard that Swift and her former flame were reuniting. With the friend gone, Martin and Shellback asked Swift to elaborate on the details of the relationship, which she described as \"break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst\". Martin then suggested that they write about the incident. Swift began playing the guitar and singing, \"We are never...\", and the song flowed rapidly afterwards. She described the process as one of the most humorous experiences she had while recording, and said the musical partners matched her expectations.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/We+Are+Never+Ever+Getting+Back+Together\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "\"Hold On, We're Going Home\" is a song by Canadian rapper Drake, featuring the R&B duo Majid Jordan. The song was produced by Noah \"40\" Shebib, OVO Sound's Majid Jordan and Nineteen85, and it is the second single from his third studio album \"Nothing Was the Same\", and was released for digital download on August 7, 2013, following the 2013 OVO Fest. It was later released to mainstream and rhythmic contemporary radio on August 13, 2013.\n\nThe song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, as well as number five on the singles chart in his native Canada. The song received positive reviews from music critics and was named the best song of 2013 by Pitchfork Media as well as number 21 on its \"Best Tracks of the Decade\" list.\n\nBefore \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" was released, Drake had an interview with MTV News about the song during the 4th Annual OVO Fest saying, \"It's me and 40 just channeling our Quincy Jones/Michael Jackson production duo,... Obviously no offense to the greats, I know we're not anywhere near that — it's just us kinda doing our thing, humbly attempting.\" He also added, \"It's not a rap record,... It's not 'Versace,' it's not 'Started from the Bottom.' In approaching this album I was like man, it would be great if we had a record that was played at weddings in 10 years or that people that are away from their families in the Armed Forces could listen to. Something that just [has] timeless writing, timeless melody. So I did it with the group that we signed to OVO called Majid Jordan.\"\n\n\"Hold On, We're Going Home\" debuted at number five on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making it Drake's thirty-third top 10 hit on the chart. This accomplishment broke the tie for second-most top ten hits with singer R. Kelly, only trailing behind rapper Lil Wayne, who has 36. The song also made the top ten in the Canadian Hot 100, peaking at number five, making it his highest-charting single in his home country. In the song's fifth week on the US Billboard Hot 100, it became Drake's 13th top ten hit, climbing at number eight. This feat gave him the most top ten hits of the year with four, including \"Fuckin' Problems\" (number 8), \"Started from the Bottom\" (number 6), and \"Love Me\" (number 9). The song reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Drake's first song to reach the top five of the Hot 100 since \"Find Your Love\". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It sold over two million copies as of January 2014. The song sold 207,000 copies in Canada in 2013. The single reached a peak of number four in the United Kingdom, giving Drake his highest-peaking single there at the time (\"One Dance\" later reached number one in 2016). It also received heavy rotation on South African radio stations, peaking a number one on the South African Airplay Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Hold+On,+We%27re+Going+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is midtempo hip-hop with an orchestral backdrop, whose lyrics concern an introduction to fame. Drake references the classic opening verse of “Hip-Hop” by Dead Prez.\n\nIt peaked in the top twenty of the United States and Canada, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted within the top five on the U.S. R&B and rap charts, his fourth consecutive top five on those charts. The song also charted in the United Kingdom and its R&B chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an experience, and the struggle between his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.\n\n\"Shut It Down\" was originally planned to be released as the first single from Thank Me Later in late 2009, but Drake ultimately chose \"Over\", a song produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles \"Best I Ever Had\" and \"Forever\". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. Drake did a lot of work for the song and the album in Jamaica.\n\nThe song \"touches on Drake reaction to fame and stardom\"; Drake told MTV News that the song was \"definitely\" a choice of his for releasing as a single, and that it was a song he did for himself. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song \"a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness\". The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Cragg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's \"Hip-Hop\", from their 2000 debut, \"Let's Get Free\". He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his \"Thriller\" video, and commented, \"He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately, what happened to him, just to honor him was great\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The pain of breaking off a relationship with someone who means so much but is two-sided and not good to be with.\n\nThe title is an allusion to James Taylor’s Fire and Rain, but Adele approaches the same themes with a thug-feminist perspective.\n\nIn the US, the song hit #1, becoming her third consecutive number one from the album. She wouldn’t reach such heights again until her comeback single Hello debuted at number one with a shocking 1.12 million copies sold in one week – the largest ever recorded in the US. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Set+Fire+to+the+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Adele examines the past and tries to right her wrongs on “Hello.” On the surface, the song appears to be about a break-up from long ago, but the song can also be interpreted as Adele’s attempt at reconciliation with her former self. In a tweet, Adele called 21 a “break-up record” and 25 a “make-up record\".\n\nThe track was released on Friday, October 23, 2015 and soon went on to break a number of records. It went straight to No. 1 in Billboard's Hot 100 (November 14, 2015) -  which combines digital sales, radio airplay and streaming data - and became the first song to sell over 1 million downloads in 1 week. The video broke VEVO's \"most viewed video in 24 hours\", getting over 27.7 million views: the record was previously held by Taylor Swift with \"Bad Blood\" (20.1 million video views). \"Hello\" is Adele’s fourth No. 1 song, following “Rolling In the Deep,” “Someone Like You” and “Set Fire to the Rain.”\n\nGrammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, \"Hello\" won a Grammy for \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Solo Performance\".\n\nIn an interview with i-D, Adele contextualizes “Hello”:\n\nThe song is about hurting someone’s feelings but it’s also about trying to stay in touch with myself, which sometimes can be a little bit hard to do,“ she explains. \"It’s about a yearning for the other side of me. When I’m away, I really, really miss my life at home. The way that I feel when I’m not in England, is…” (she pauses) “desperation. I can’t breathe anywhere else.” Why? “I dunno. I’m so attached to my whole life here. I get worked up that I’m missing out on things. So ‘Hello’ is about wanting to be at home and wanting to reach out to everyone I’ve ever hurt – including myself – and apologize for it. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Hello\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

An understated love song to her hometown of West Norwood, South London, the singer wrote it in just 10 minutes at age 15 after having an argument wherein her mother tried to convince Adele to leave home to go to university in Liverpool.\n\nThe song was rereleased as a single on July 22, 2008 with this alternate cover.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Blues & Soul, Adele explained the song’s origins:\n\n\"I wrote ‘Hometown…’ on the guitar – it’s just four chords pressing one string – and it was actually the first song I ever wrote from start to finish. It was kind of about me and my mum not agreeing on where I should go to university. Because, though at first I’d wanted to go to Liverpool, later I changed my mind and wanted to go to university in London. But, because I love being at home and I’m really dependent on my mum, she still wanted me to go to Liverpool. So that I’d have to learn how to do things on my own, rather than still be coming home for dinner, having her do my washing and stuff like that. So in that way it was a kind of protest song about cherishing the memories – whether good or bad – of your hometown. Whereas – having only been to Liverpool about twice – there’s nothing there that comforts me, here in London – even if I’m having a really shit day – there’s still something I love about the place. So really yeah, in general it is an ode to the place where I’ve always lived\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Hometown+Glory\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
