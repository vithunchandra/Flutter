It was released in Italy on 27 April 2018 as the fourth (fifth overall) and the final single from the album.\n\nAccording to Sheeran, the theme of the song is about looking back at an early relationship and, despite being initially angry and bitter at the breakup, later coming to realise that his first love was happier with someone else. He said: \"I remember the first girl I was with, that the first and most of the second album was about, that I was with from school. And I remember the guy she was with, meeting him one day and being like, he is so much suited to her than I ever was. Seeing them together, we never looked like that, we were never that couple, we were never that happy. So it was having a kind of epiphany moment, and writing a song that was basically that.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/Happier\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was included on the deluxe edition of his third studio album ÷ (2017) and is the fifteenth track. After the album's release it charted at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart.  Sheeran recorded the song together with Beoga. \n\n\"Nancy Mulligan\" is one of the most personal songs on the album, telling the story of how his grandparents, William Sheeran, a Protestant from Belfast, Northern Ireland and Anne \"Nancy\" Mulligan, a Catholic from the Republic of Ireland, met, fell in love during the Second World War and got married at the Wexford border. Sheeran said: \"They got engaged and no one turned up at their wedding. He stole all the gold teeth in his dental surgery and melted them down into a wedding ring, and they wore borrowed clothes to get married, and just basically have this kind of Romeo and Juliet romance, which is like the most romantic thing. So I thought I'd write a song about it and make it a jig \" .\n\nIn an interview with the Irish Times, talking about the song's Irish roots, Sheeran said \"I don't think enough people use Irish folk in pop music... Hopefully if these songs are successful, more people will do a bit more like it.\"\n\nIn 2017, the song was covered by the Irish country singer Mike Denver with an accompanying music video.\n\nSheeran performed the song, backed on stage by Beoga, during his headline performance at the Glastonbury Festival 2017.\n\nIn 2022, the song was covered by YouTube group The Wellermen, featuring Malinda Kathleen Reese, and Malinda also released a solo a cappella gender-swapped short of the first verse. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/Nancy+Mulligan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Blige hit, “Mary’s Joint.” If you know Drake then you know the OVO Sound chief has a love for ‘90s R&B, so it should come as no surprise that Drizzy rehashed a record from Mary J. Blige’s classic 1994 album My Life.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Drake and the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul hooked up. In 2009, Aubrey guested on Mary’s “The One” from her Stronger With Each Tear LP, and then the next year they performed “Fancy” together at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/WESton+RoAd+FLOws\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Future, on the other hand, blasts the Grammys and takes a subtle dig at rapper Desiigner, whose hit song “Panda” has been labeled as a Future rip-off.\n\nDrake echoed Future’s attitude on 2015’s “Blessings” by Big Sean:\n\nI could give two fucks ‘bout where the Grammys go\n\nThis is Drake and Future’s first song since the all-conquering What a Time to Be Alive mixtape in 2015. It was originally a Future song which started at Future’s interlude and had a second Future verse, but Future gave the song to Drake for Views. Future later premiered this alternate version on his FBG Radio station in February 2017.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/702562389678559233\n\nDrake’s relationship with the awards goes back to 2009, when “Best I Ever Had” was nominated for two Grammys. He wound up losing in both categories.\n\nIn 2013, Drake won the Best Rap Album Grammy for ‘Take Care’—he found out while driving to the ceremony. Drake told Fuse: “And then we just started going nuts. And we got out—literally in the middle of the street—blocked cars, we all hugged. And then when I got back in the car, I realized that I had torn my suit. So I stopped at a hotel, I told the tailor to meet me there, and she sewed up my suit.”\n\nIn 2014, Drake talked about the Grammys with Rolling Stone: “It becomes more apparent how irrelevant our genre is to them. They were trying to utilize me to sell the show, requesting me to come and perform ‘Hold On We’re Going Home,’ but they didn’t nominate it for anything! They’re calling me, e-mailing me every day to do some elaborate performance and bring them viewers, but I didn’t get a nomination for Album of the Year. I didn’t get a nomination for Song of the Year.”\n\nIn 2016, the Grammys ran a Super Bowl commercial announcing that Drake would be there. He quickly corrected them on Twitter: “I am not performing at the Grammy Awards…but hey it’s the thought that counts.”\n\nAfter the 2016 Grammys, the organization announced several changes. One was the rethinking of the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category—it became Best Rap/Sung Performance. ThinkProgress speculated that this move was inspired by Drake, who does not need to collaborate to have both singing and rapping on his tracks. They called it “The Drake Change.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Grammys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It’s just to show you the two extreme moods that we have. We love our summers but we also make our winters work…You start to value your days a lot more when most people won’t go outside type of thing.\"\n\nThe vocals on the track come from OVO labelmate Majid Al Maskati, the vocalist half of R&B duo Majid Jordan. His vocals are featured on Drake’s “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” There are no samples used on this song. The vocals are all performed by Majid Al Maskati and all the instruments are played by producer & songwriter Maneesh.\nThis song was produced by Maneesh, a Toronto producer whose first major credit was on Travis Scott’s Rodeo. He also worked on Drake’s “Charged Up.”\n\nThis song’s melody and vocals are reminiscent of Smokey Robinson’s 1965 single “Ooo Baby Baby.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Summers+Over+Interlude\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was later reproduced and remastered for inclusion on their debut album Night Visions and appears as the sixth track on the album.\n\nThe song, originally featured on the band's It's Time EP released in March 2011, was one of the earliest Imagine Dragons songs to incorporate electronic music into their traditional rock band set-up evident in their earlier works. The song, along with most of the It's Time EP, used electronic music to create the timbre and texture of the song rather than forming the melodies and riffs of the song. A similar concept was first used by the band for \"Hear Me\", a song off their 2010 extended play Hell and Silence. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons/_/Amsterdam\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song appears as the ninth track on the album. The song peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Rock Songs chart.\n\nThe song, compared to the former half of the Night Visions album, is one of Imagine Dragons' darker songs, and like most of the songs on Night Visions, it makes use of the Bass drum to set the overall tone and mood of the song. The song incorporates a jagged-edge production effect, where the guitar chords are separately recorded and mixed separately from the recording itself. When chords in the song are not repeated and flow through, the recording plays normally. However, if the chords repeat themselves, they literally repeat themselves in the recording as well to produce a broken record effect, as if the recording is skipping over itself. The song also makes use of synthesizer jabs to emphasize the belligerency of the song's atmosphere and mood. Also notable is that the lead-in unusually lasts three beats, unlike most songs where usually the lead-in would last two or a single beat before the song starts. \"Bleeding Out\" has been interpreted many ways, but with the consistent factor of sacrifice. Most agree that the song is about people giving all they have for another. They are willing to do everything in their power to protect this people, and that includes \"bleeding out for [them].\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons/_/Bleeding+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
